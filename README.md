##Audio Sample Browser

Sorry, there is no working code yet.
I'm learning Python. All in planning / study phase now.
In the end it should be a Sample File Browser made with Python and GTK3+.

The app should let you browse the filesystem showing only audio files (wav,ogg,mp3 etc)

Clicking on a file should play it instantly.
Double-click opens the file.
